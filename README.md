# trezor_nuri
I slightly change the trezor one hw (https://github.com/trezor/trezor-hardware/tree/master/electronics/trezor_one) in order to solder the components easily. I use 0805 package components. This design can be more popular for the maker community. I also watch this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZmv4wG6_PE) and do not use the resistors that are not populated also on the original trezor one. Unfortunately I can not make my design work :( 
I saw that all the voltage points have 3v. I am not expert but I try to upload the demo code and as well as the firmware as described here (https://mcudev.github.io/trezor-dev-kit/) I can upload the bin files without problem. The STlink v2 also finds the STM32 IC.
I am looking for help from the experts. I am here to try your all suggestions.
